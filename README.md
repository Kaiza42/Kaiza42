About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a passionate developer with a strong interest in video game creation. I enjoy exploring how games are built, which led me to work with technologies like Unity and Godot to create engaging games.

ðŸŽ® My main goal is to develop immersive and fun games. However, I donâ€™t limit myself to game development. I also enjoy working on other development projects, such as interactive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ’» I am open to various types of projects and appreciate diversity in software development. Whether it's in the game industry or elsewhere, I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.

ðŸ“¬ If you'd like to collaborate, discuss a project, or exchange ideas, feel free to contact me:
